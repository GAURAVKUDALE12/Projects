Decision Tree Income Predication

Decision Tree converts a set of features and observations into a set of rules, resulting in a prediction.
It gives a tree in which each node is a splitting feature that divides the observations into branches with an objective of creating homogeneous subsets.

The impurity of a split is measured commonly in two ways :

* GINI Index
* Entropy

The splitting variable maximizes information gain (or minimizes impurity) which the difference between impurity before the split and after the split.

Dataset(s) Description
Request you to go to the link given above and read in details about the feature description.
It will give you a detailed idea about all the features avaibale in the dataset.
If you follow the link and see the data folder, you will get two files there one for train and one for test.
So, when we are doing this lab activity, we do not have to split for train and test, instead we need to use and process both the files separately and complete the lab activity. adult_train.csv and adult_test.csv.
